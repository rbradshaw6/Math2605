It is justified to use LU or QR factorizations over finding 
the inverse matrix because sometimes the LU or QR factorizations
can be more efficient. Though it may sacrifice accuracy, for time 
sensitive computations it can be better to be quick than to be accurate.
This kind of situation is often seen with graphics processing.
