It is suggested that you run tests from tests.java

To run power_method:

this fn can be run from tests.java (or any file in this dir) as
Leslie.power_method(Matrix a, double tol, Vector u)

This will print out the number of iterations, the error, and the resulting alpha
value. all of these will be labeled.
