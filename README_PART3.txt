Example tests are in the main method of Leslie.java

To run power_method:

this fn can be run from tests.java (or any file in this dir) as
Leslie.power_method(Matrix a, double tol, Vector u)

This will print out the number of iterations, the error, and the resulting alpha
value. all of these will be labeled.

To calculate the population at a certain decade:

Leslie.calcPop(Matrix a, Vector x, int decades)

this will print the population distribution after a certain # of decades.
